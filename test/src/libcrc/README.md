Third party CRC16 Calculation
=============================

This file is CRC16 calculation that comes from
[libcrc](https://github.com/lammertb/libcrc). This is used for the CRC16
calculation for the test code in order to have CRC calculating code for the
test framework, that is separate from the crc16 code used for the AVR library
simulation.
